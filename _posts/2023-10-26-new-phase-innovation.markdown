## Achievements.

### Unet Operating System.

Unet is a Unix-like operating system that offers the best compatibility for various platforms. Whether you need a server, a desktop, or an embedded system, Unet can meet your needs. Unet also provides advanced networking, security, and storage features, and supports most popular embedded storage and networking devices.

#### Why is it an important part of the process?

Unet has been the most prominent part of Lithicsoft’s journey and process after more than five years of development. It has given us valuable experience and lessons from our mistakes with Unet, which inspired us to pursue further advancement from it.

#### But what happened?

Unfortunately, Unet’s performance and development declined over time, not as before. The features included in Unet became less quality and less frequent.

### Lithicsoft Research AI.

Lithicsoft Research AI is a chatbot that explores artificial intelligence and integrates Lithicsoft with the latest AI research trends. It can generate various types of content, such as poems, stories, code, essays, songs and celebrity parodies, using its own words and knowledge. It can also help users with writing, rewriting, improving or optimizing their content.

#### The problem.

With a limited base, we only managed to create a chatbot that uses the oasst1 dataset and a gpt_neox model with over 1 billion parameters.

## Overcome.

### With Unet.

To enhance the development and performance of Unet, we need to overhaul its Kernel and Userspace. However, the current Linix Kernel is too damaged and full of vulnerabilities, so we need to replace it with the new Xenon Kernel, which is more secure and efficient.

### With Lithicsoft Research AI.

We have invested in upgrading our facilities and equipment for chatbot development and enhanced its quality and performance.

## Target.

We devise and implement solutions every day to overcome challenges and help Lithicsoft achieve its vision and objectives.

#### 1 - Launch Unet System 2 by May 1, next year.
#### 2 - Accelerate the development of Unet and Lithicsoft Research AI with efficiency and quality.
#### 3 - Resolve any issues that impede development.
#### 4 - Rebuild Lithicsoft Inc.
#### 5 -Optimize Lithicsoft Inc.'s operations and performance.
#### 6 - Foster a community of developers and supporters who are passionate about Unet and Lithicsoft's Software.

We hope to achieve great results in the future with these proposals.

## Sincere thanks to those who have accompanied and supported us all the time!
